This is a port of the popular browser and mobile game. Use your arrow keys to move the tiles. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one!

Files
	This game saves one file to the main memory. You can find it in Memory Manager / Main Memory / @2048/ GAME
	This file contains your current gameplay and your highscore. If you delete it, you won't be able to continue your paused game and your highscore will be reset.

Bugs
	Please note that this is the first release of this program. Please send bug reports to my e-mail address (balping.official@gmail.com) or post it at the forum thread at Chemetech.
